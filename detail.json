The front air cavity expands to the sides with a chrome border and the front bumper is shaped differently to emphasize the strong, aggressive car.+BMW X7 is equipped with BMW Laserlight headlights for a lighting range of up to 600 meters, more than double that of conventional LED headlights. This helps to ensure the safety of the driver when traveling at night. In addition, the headlights are also integrated with Adaptive technology, which helps to adjust the lighting angle when cornering, improving the driver's visibility. Specifically, the car uses electronic sensors to determine the speed of travel, the size of the turn to adjust the appropriate projection angle. In addition, smart Adaptive technology also limits the light flow to pedestrians and oncoming vehicles ahead, ensuring safety for oncoming road users without being dazzled.",
